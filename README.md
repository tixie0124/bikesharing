There seem to be a negative correlation between age and average trip duration. Customers who are born in 2000 uses the program higher than other age groups, on average. However, there are many outliers and inaccuracies in the age data - some has birthday earlier than 1890.

The bar chart above confirms that the peak hours revolve around 8 am and 6 pm everyday, when people get to and get off work.

## Summary
The results indicate that there are more male users of the program than female users. The program is most popular during morning and afternoon rush hours. Any maintainance of the bikes should avoid those timeframes. In addition, customers with younger age tend to have longer trips than customers with older age. However, this data only represents NYC, a place with many travelling methods that are more convenient than cars. On the other hand, rural residence overwhelmingly rely on cars for travelling. In addition, people who lives in NYC are generally more environmentally concious than people from elsewhere. Consequently, they rely more on public transportations and bikes. The data in a rural area may be drastically different. These are all factors that need to taken into consideration.
